## Description

**"The Award-Winning Science & Tech Chatbot Triumphs at 'Hackaphasia' AI Hackathon!"**

The aim of this project was to craft a cutting-edge Science and Technology chatbot using **Python**, **NLP techniques**, **spaCy**, **Gradio**, and **Hugging Face transformers** alongside my talented teammates **Dhawan** and **Vasu**, securing the 3rd position at **'Hackaphasia,'** the 24-hour AI hackathon organized by **IEEE Computer Society** during the Phaseshift event at our college.

Our bot showcased advanced features such as **semantic understanding**, **information extraction**, **interactivity**, **summarization**, **user query learning**, and **scalability**. We meticulously engineered it to extract embeddings from text using **spaCy** and a custom model, with **Hugging Face transformers** enhancing our summarization capabilities.
