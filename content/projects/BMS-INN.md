## Description

I had created this hostel website **"BMS INN"** as my college web dev project in my 3rd semester solely on my own. It took me a month to complete this project. Being a hostelite, this project is more like an emotion to me. This website is built in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## Motivation

Being a hostelite myself, I recognized the need for a hostel website to optimize our college experience. My website aims to simplify hostel life by providing a centralized platform for communication, information sharing, and accessing essential resources.

## Overview
The main heading of the website is **"BMS Hostel,"** with five main categories or sections: **"Admission,"** **"Facilities,"** **"Events,"** **"Testimonial,"** and **"Contact"** along with Login and SignUp options.

- Under the "Admission" section, there are three sub-sections: "Admission Process," "Allotment of Room," and "Vacating the Room."
- The "Facilities" section is also divided into three sub-sections: "Accommodation," "Hostel Mess," and "Hospital."
- Within the "Events" section, users can explore "Rafaga," "Food Fest," and "Hostel Days."
- Both the "Testimonial" and "Contact"sections remain undivided.
- Login and SignUp is essential to view the contents of Events and Facilities in depth.
