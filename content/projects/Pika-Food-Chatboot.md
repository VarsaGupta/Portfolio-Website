In this project, I created the **"Pika-Food Ordering Chatbot"** utilizing **Python**, **FastAPI**, **MySQL**, and **DialogFlow** to streamline the food ordering process. The chatbot offers users an intuitive platform for placing orders, featuring **effortless ordering**, **real-time interaction**, and seamless **database integration**. Leveraging **FastAPI**, I ensured smooth communication between the user interface and the backend, enabling dynamic updates and interactions for a responsive ordering experience.
