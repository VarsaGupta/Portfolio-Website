    subtitle: "I am 21 years old, currently in the 3rd year (Graduating 2025), pursuing a career in Information Science and Engineering from BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, India. Born and brought up in Birgunj, Nepal. I completed my high school education in Nepal in 2020, with Science + Computers as my background.\n\n\nThe reason I chose to pursue science and engineering was my deep interest in problem-solving and innovation. Consequently, I dedicated myself to my studies and earned a full scholarship to pursue Computer Science Engineering at BMSCE in Bangalore, India.I have a keen interest in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science, and I'm presently learning and working on the skills required to expertise in the same.At my leisure, I take some time off to work on things I'm passionate about. I write articles and publish them on the Internet. Sometimes, I read books related to Self-help, Biography and Economy, and watch youtube prodcasts.I also enjoy going on sites like HackerRank and trying out their programming challenges. At the weekend, I love travelling and trakking.I strongly believe that words and data have the most power to change the world"
